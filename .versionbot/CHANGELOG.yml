    - subject: Switches buffer behavior to block by default in Kuberentes.
      hash: 929c5f5209fe6b6e80e12980ae121f27d3972b17
      body: |
        Kubernetes typically have a higher volume of events than
        a balena device but also use more powerful devices that
        can provide larger buffers. The behavior can still be
        overriden by using the VECTOR_BUFFER_WHEN_FULL environment
        variable.

    - subject: Adds Kubernetes support and re-organizes configuration templates.
      hash: 7789c3fd4fb3e9a309981417373ae6ce9942c4ed
      body: |
        Now supports log collection from Kubernetes API.  This allows the
        logshipper balenablock to be used both in a Kubernetes cluster
        and on a balena device.
        Allows easier maintenance of configurations and reduce the nesting
        of configuraton properties.
        Vector sink now allows adjustment of request timeout.
