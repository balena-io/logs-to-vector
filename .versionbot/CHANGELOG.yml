        Variable placeholders in these string templates will be replaced

        Certificates used to be only accepted in base64 format.
        This update allows users to set certificates as multi-line
        strings in environment variables. This also makes it easy
        to mount certificates in kubernetes secrets as environment
        variables for logs-to-vector.

        Kubernetes typically have a higher volume of events than
        a balena device but also use more powerful devices that
        can provide larger buffers. The behavior can still be
        overriden by using the VECTOR_BUFFER_WHEN_FULL environment
        variable.
